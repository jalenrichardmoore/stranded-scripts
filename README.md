# **Stranded - Scripts**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all necessary scripts for the Unity game, *Stranded*. *Stranded* is a first-person, survival shooter game where the player's goal is to defend watchtowers they construct from sea monsters long enough to escape an island. These scripts control player mechanics, enemy AI behavior, UI interaction, and overall game management systems.
